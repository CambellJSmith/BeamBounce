# BeamBounce
A game about dodging laser beams

This is the code and assets for my game "BeamBounce" Feel free to use it. All the art was made by using the primitive 2D shapes built into unity and some sprite masks.

Please enjoy, do whatever you want with the code. I'd appreciate attribution but it's not nessecary.

The files contain no 'Library' folder due to size constraints but that doesn't matter. The first time opening the project will just take a little bit longer to generate a new 'Library' folder for you. You can find a live version of this game on here. https://simmer.io/@CambellJsmith/fishtank](https://simmer.io/@CambellJsmith/beambounce)
